// Building a New Profession
// If none of the professions suit your Agent, use these guidelines to build a new one.
// PROFESSIONAL SKILLS: Pick ten professional skills for the new profession. Divide 400 skill points between them. Add those points to each skillâ€™s starting level. As a rule
// of thumb, professional skills should be 30% to 50%. No professional skill may be higher than 60%.
// BONDS: 3
// CUSTOMIZE: For each additional bond (to a maximum
// of 4), reduce professional skill points by 50. For each bond removed (to a minimum of 1), add 50 profession-
// al skill points.
