                            We're fighting a war against the inevitable. And it's a war we're going to lose. 
                            But we're going to win the battles. We're going to make the bastards work for it. 
                            We're going to make them take ground inch by inch. And we're going to make them 
                            bleed for every inch they take.

                            with this psycho burnout and do the impossible against the unbelievable and keep the 
                            future at bay for another day?
